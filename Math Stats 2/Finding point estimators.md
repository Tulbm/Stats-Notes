We have seen that it is perfectly possible for there to be more than  
one potential estimator for the same parameter. The previous section  
provides us evaluation criteria of selecting a better or optimal estima-  
tors among many. In this section, we focus on different methods of  
constructing an estimator for a given parameter. We will introduce  
the simplest method: the method of moments, the most popular  
method (historically): method of maximum likelihood, and the  
increasingly popular methods of Bayesian estimation
