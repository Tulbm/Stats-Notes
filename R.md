# objects
- objects
	- declaration
		- vectorname<-c(1,2,3,4)
	- typing the object name outputs a list of the data set
	- mean(mydatainR$weight)
		- mydatainR is the object
		- weight is a variable inside the object
			- mean(weight) only if the object is attached already
			- ![](https://i.imgur.com/6wviavq.png)
	- `mean(mydatainR[,1])
		- mean of the first column in the data set
	- `sd(mydatainR$weight[1:3])
		- sd of just the first 3 weights
	- r is case sensitive
# general commands
- commands
	- data management
		- objects()
			- R lists all saved objects
		- head(object)
			- shows the first few rows of the data
		- text()
			- text(x, y = NULL, labels = seq_along(x$x), adj = NULL, pos = NULL, offset = 0.5, vfont = NULL, cex = 1, col = NULL, font = NULL, ...)
		- split()
			- split(x, f, drop = FALSE)
				- **x:** represents data vector or data frame
				- **f:** represents factor to divide the data
				- **drop:** represents logical value which indicates if levels that do not occur should be dropped
			- split(puffinsA1, puffinsA1$Cloud)
		- attach(mydatainR)
			- R will look in this date set for variable names
			- can then use commands directly with the variables
			- problematic if its the same name as another object
	- basic formulas
		- pnorm(value,mean,sd)
			- area to the left of value of the PDF
			- default = standard normal distribution, mean = 0, sd = 1
		- qnorm(area,mean,sd)
			- outputs value that has the area given to the left of it
		- mean(vectorname)
			- mean of the vector
		- choose(n,x)
			- combination formula/binomial coefficient
			- $$  \begin{pmatrix}   n\\   x   \end{pmatrix}= \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}$$
			- dbinom(x,n,P(X))
			- pbinom(x,n,P(X))
				- for when we want probability of <= x
		- var(vectorname)
			- gives the variance of the vector
		- sd(vectorname)
			- standard deviation of the vector
			- same thing as sqrt(var(vectorname))
		- summary(vectorname)
			- yields the mean and the 5-number summary (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum)
		- max, min, sum, median
	- defining functions
		- fib_closed <- function(n) { 1/sqrt(5) * (((1 + sqrt(5))/2)^n - ((1 - sqrt(5))/2)^n)}
		- print(fib_closed(seq(30)))
			- seq(30) = `[1,30`
	- importing csv files
		- mydatainR<-read.csv(file.choose(),sep=",",header=TRUE)
			- sep=","because its comma separated values(csv)
				- can be omitted if the file is .csv
			- header=TRUE means that the first row represents column names, not data values
			- both are the default so can just do mydatainR<-read.csv(file.choose())
				- empty choose opens file explorer, can also specify the path
					- mydatainR<-read.csv("C:/Documents and Settings/JB/My Documents/mydata.csv",header=TRUE)
	- help(commandname) / ?commandname
		- gives syntax, possibles options and examples for the command
	- vectors can be used in commands
		- `mysecondvector<- 10+2*myfirstvector

# Calculations
- calculating

		- dbinom(x,n,p)
			- yields P (X = x) for a binomial distribution
			- dbinom(3,10,.5) yields 0.1171875
			- gives the probability that the random variable is exactly equal to x
		- pbinom(x,n,p)
			- yields P (X ≤ x) for a binomial distribution
			- pbinom(3,10,.5) yields 0.171875
			- gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to x
				- the cumulative distribution function (??)
	- poisson probabilities

	- normal and t distribution
		- normal
			- pnorm(z)
				- yields the area to the left of z under the standard normal curve
				- pnorm(-1.96) yields the value 0.02499790, the area to the left of −1.96 under the standard normal curve
				- pnorm(x,mu,sigma)
					- yields the area to the left of x under a normal curve with μ = mu and σ = sigma
					- pnorm(2.5,2,1.8) yields 0.6094085, which  is the area to the left of 2.5 under a normal curve with a mean of 2 and standard deviation of 1.8
						- mu = mean
						- sigma = standard deviation
			- qnorm(p)
				- gives the value of z such that the area to the left of z under a standard normal curve is p
					- inverse function of pnorm
				- qnorm(p, mu, sigma)
					- yields the value of x such that the area to the left of x under a normal curve with a mean of mu and standard deviation of sigma
					- qnorm(.43,12,24) would yield the 43rd percentile of a normal distribution with a mean of 12 and a standard deviation of 24
			- dnorm(x, mu, sigma)
				- yields the probability density function (height of the curve at point x) for a normal distribution with a mean of mu and standard deviation of sigma
				- normally used when plotting the normal distribution pdf
			- rnorm(n ,mu, sigma)
				- randomly generates n values from a normal distribution with a mean of mu and a standard deviation of sigma
				- often used in (my?) simulation functions
			- punif(value,parameter1,parameter2)
				- probability (of) uniform distribution
				- $P(X\leq value)$ between parameter1 and 2
			- qunif(value,parameter1,parameter2)
				- inverse function of punif, gives value when inputting the area
		- t
			- pt(x, degrees of freedom)
				- yields the area to the left of x under a t distribution with df degrees of freedom
				- pt(-1.96,5) yields the value 0.05364398, the area to the left of −1.96 under a t distribution with 5 degrees of freedom
			- qt(area, degrees of freedom)
				- inverse of pt
				- yields the value x such that the area to the left of x under a t distribution with df degrees of freedom is p
				- qt(0.975,23) yields 2.068658
	- f distribution
		- pf(x, numerator df, denominator df)
			- area to the left, [[P-values|p-value]] is to the right
	- tests
		- t procedures
			- one sample
				- t.test(mydatainR$weight,mu=10)
					- tests the null hypothesis that the true mean of the weight variable is 10
					- It also outputs a 95% confidence interval for the true mean of the weight variable
						- The default is a two-sided alternative hypothesis, and the default confidence level is 95%.
			- two sample
				- t.test(weight~group)
					- tests the null hypothesis that μA = μB and outputs a 95% confidence interval for μA − μB
					- R chooses the name that comes first alphabetically to be Group 1 for the grouping variable
					- default = Welch method (unpooled variance)
						- = t.test(weight~group,var.equal=FALSE)
							- does not assume the population variances are equal (welch)
						- t.test(weight~group,var.equal=TRUE
							- uses the pooled-variance procedure
							- assumes the population variances are equal
		- chisq.test(counts,rep(1/9,9))
			- rep = 1/9 * 9 times
