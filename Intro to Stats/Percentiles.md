	- Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF)
		- all values <= percentile
		- 510 = 78th percentile

	- quartiles
		- Q1 = 25th percentile
		- Q2 = median = 50th percentile
		- Q3 = 75th percentile
	- five-number summary
		- listing of minimum,Q1,median,Q3,maximum
		- boxplot = a plot of the number summary
			- jittered boxplot
				- all sample points appear on the plot
			- whiskers always stop at a value in the dataset
				- cannot be bigger than 1.5xIQR
				- values bigger than that are outliers
			- large samplesize = more outliers, while the plot stays the same
				- can lead to false conclusions
				- keep in mind that ~1% will be outliers

	- Interquartile Range (IQR)
		- IQR = Q3 - Q1
		- a descriptive measure of variability
