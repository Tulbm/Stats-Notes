## Pearson Correlation Coefficient
- $r=\frac{\sum(X_i-\bar X)(Y_i-\bar Y)}{\sqrt{\sum(X_i-\bar X)^2\cdot\sum(Y_i-\bar Y)^2}}$
	- or $r=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum(\frac{X_i-\bar{X}}{s_X})(\frac{Y_i-\bar{Y}}{s_Y})=\hat{\beta}_1\frac{s_X}{s_Y}$
	- function of $\hat{\beta_{1}}$ with the standard deviations of X and Y
		- sd is always positive, so r will always have the same sign as $\hat{\beta_{1}}$ (slope)
- properties of the correlation coefficient
	- r is unitless
	- $-1\leq r\leq 1$
	- r has the same sign as $\hat{\beta_{1}}$
	- if r = 1 or -1, all points fall directly on a line
		- values close to 1 or -1 indicate a strong linear relationship
	- for simple linear regression models, $r^2=R^2$ ([[Coefficient of Determination]])
