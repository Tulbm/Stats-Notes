			- $$f(x)=\frac{1}{d-c}for\ c\leq x \leq d$$
			- 0 elsewhere
		- mean = median = halfway point = $\frac{d+c}{2}$
			- $\mu = \frac{d+c}{2}$ and the variance is $\sigma^2=\frac{1}{12}(d-c)^2$ 
			- X has uniform distribution between c and d
				- $X\sim U(c,d)$ 
				- $U(0,1)$ is the most common uniform distribution
