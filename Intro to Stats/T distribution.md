# T distribution
- generalizes the standard normal distribution
- symmetric about 0
- bell shape
- unknown variances
- uses degrees of freedom 
- t distribution is symmetric about 0
	- Mean = Median = 0
- has a lower peak then the SND and more area in the tails

- the variance of the t distribution is $\frac{df}{df-2}$ for degrees of freedom > 2
	- degrees of freedom = $n-1$
	- the t distribution tends toward the SND as $df \rightarrow \infty$ 
- $df = n-1$
