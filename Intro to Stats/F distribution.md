- $F$ distribution
	- the ratio of two sample variances has an $F$ distribution
		- if both populations are normally distributed
	- has 2 parameters
		- $\nu_{1}$
			- degrees of freedom for the numerator
		- $\nu_{2}$
			- degrees of freedom for the denominator
		- $\frac{S_{1}^2}{S_{2}^2}\sim F(n_{1}-1,n_{2}-1)$
			- (numerator df, denominator df)

	- distribution of the F test statistic under $H_{0}$
		- if the null hypothesis is true, the value we get from F is contained in that distribution
			- extreme outlier $\to$ low [[P-values|p-value]] $\to$ low chance that our hypothesis is true
			- area to the right only, [[R]]
