- states that the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed for large sample sizes, regardless of the distribution from which we are sampling (normal or not)
	- we can often use the well-developed statistical inference procedures that are based on a normal distribution, given we  have a large sample size
- very rough guideline
	- for $n\ \text{sample size}\geq 30$, the sample mean can be considered approximately normally distributed
- sometimes we cant know the distribution of X, but Z using $\bar X$ will have the normal distribution (so we can easily calculate it)
