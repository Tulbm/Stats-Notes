## Population
- Individuals/units/cases
	- the objects on which a measurement is made
- population
	- the set of all individuals or units of interest to an investigator.
- parameter
	- a numerical characteristic of a population
- sample
	- a subset of individuals or units selected from the population
- statistic
	- a numerical characteristic of a sample
## Sampling Methods
- simple random sampling
	- a way of drawing an unbiased sample from a population
	- A simple random sample of size n is a sample drawn in such a fashion that each possible sample of size n had the same chance of being selected
		- *implication* = every member of the population has the same chance of being selected
		- n/N = sample size / population size
	- typically drawn without replacement
		- a member of the population cannot appear in the sample more than once
- stratified random sampling
	- in a population with subgroups, where individuals in the subgroups are more similar to each other
	- divide the population into the subgroups (strata) and draw SRS (simple random samples) from each subgroup
	- the use mathematical techniques to combine the information from different stratas
- cluster sampling
	- population is divided into clusters in such a way that it is easier to sample clusters of individuals rather than the individuals themselves
- systematic sampling
	- (sampling every `k`th unit)
	- in a situation where the units are ordered in some fashion
	- select a starting point and then every kth item after that
