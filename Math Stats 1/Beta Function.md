$$
B(\alpha,\beta)=\left[ \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)} \right]^{-1}
$$

Inverse to denote the relationship with [[Counting Theorems|combinatorics]], [[Gamma function]] is the continuous factorial, so it is like the inverse of ${ n\choose k }$ 

If the gamma function was not weirdly shifted by one, it would look like
$$
B(\alpha,\beta)=\frac{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)(\alpha+\beta+1)}
$$
which is one argument for the weird gamma function. Another one is the fact that $\Gamma(0)=-1!=\infty$
